# Principal-Component-Analysis

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract insights from crime statistics data covering all 50 states of America. The findings were quite interestingâ€”two main clusters were identified, revealing a pattern that seemed to align with whether a state is traditionally considered a "red" or "blue" state.<br />
